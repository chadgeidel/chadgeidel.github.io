## Quarter year update on my resolutions.

### Goal progress.
1. Books - I'm 2.5 books in.
    - Lock In by John Scalzi
    - I read the first [Dune Graphic Novel](https://dunenovels.com/dune-the-graphic-novel-book-1/) and, frankly, was very disappointed in the mundane artwork. I won't be reading the others.
    - I started the first book in the [Silo Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(series)) (Wool) after watching the Apple TV Series. The book wasn't engaging me, so I put it down for a bit.
    - I've started Boneshaker by Cherie Priest and I'm enjoying it. I am definitely going to finish this one!
2. Games - Better progress here! 
    - [iRacing](https://www.iracing.com/). I was at 1800 for a little bit, but I switched from MX-5 to Ferrari 296 and Multiclass racing so that dropped. I was in a limited racing series for a while, but I've kind of burned 
    - I finished [Super Mario Bros. Wonder](https://supermariobroswonder.nintendo.com/). Fun game but probably not my favorite 2D Mario game. Still, I recommend it!
    - I wanted to play [Pacific Drive](https://www.pacificdrivegame.com/), and got a few hours into it but I have this problem where I want to dedicate "real time" to a game and that always trips me up. A "run" in Pacific Drive is about 30-45 minutes and that's beyond what my brain thinks is a "one quick play" game. So, I picked up another game in between (I still plan on finishing this!)
    - I've gotten pretty into [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) [schmups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_%27em_up) and I've already spent 76 hours (!!) on [Brotato](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/) which is a riot. It's a quick game you can play one run in about 20 mintues and it's super addictive!
    - Along with Brotato, I've also picked up [Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/) and I've got 13 hours into that. It's another easy to pick up, easy to play game. 
3. Cycling - I'm not doing great! I've ridden all of 22 miles (see my [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/chadgeidel)) so that's not a lot of progress. I haven't signed up for any big rides, and I'm waiting for the house sale to make any big decisions here.
4. Car stuff - No house sale yet so car stuff is on hold. I have decided on my next daily driver (the Elise is NOT a daily driver!) and that is a [Ford Maverick](https://www.ford.com/trucks/maverick/). I'm going to get a "base" model with the hybrid motor which averages over 45 MPG. I'm looking forward to that. I really just need something to throw my bike into for longer trips.
5. Travel - No trips yet. Still wating on the house to sell.
6. Education - I haven't even opened up the Rosetta Stone app! *sobs*
7. Tech / Career - The last 2 months have been personally disappointing as I'm trying (and not succeeding) to learn React. I need to redouble my efforts. I'm not pushing for a promotion yet, our company recently hired an outside team to help us move our Windows Forms application to the cloud (using React) and that has just started. I finally updated the theme on this blog. That was a big thing holding me back from updating. It sounds silly, but I wanted to do that before I posted any more. Now I don't have an excuse.

### House Sale
As I mentioned, I'm in a "holding pattern" waiting on the sale of my house. I finalized my divorce last year and in the divorce agreement we agreed to have the house on the market in March '24. That didn't happen and now it looks like it might be early June before the house is on sale. Here's hoping for a good price, but until then, I'm really "pausing" on any big plans.

### Other things
I've caught up on some TV series I've been meaning to watch, but I'm still deep in my lists. Here's a short list of things I'm currently watching:
  - Shogun
  - Outer Limits
  - Loudermilk
  - Man in the High Castle
